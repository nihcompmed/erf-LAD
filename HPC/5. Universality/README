This folder contains materials for inferring networks using patches of the embryo.

make-swarm:
    - A bash script 
    - Command: bash make-swarm
    - Output: 
        - LAD_patch_{30,45}.cmd

LAD_30.cmd:
    - 2970 commands to run LAD_patch.py (99 columns for each 10-fold croos-validation, 3 sections)
    - 2970 commands to run LAD_patch_z.py (99 columns for each 10-fold croos-validation, 3 sections)
    
LAD_45.cmd:
    - 1980 commands to run LAD_patch.py (99 columns for each 10-fold cross-validation, 2 sections)
    - 1980 commands to run LAD_patch_z.py (99 columns for each 10-fold cross-validation, 2 sections)
    
LAD_patch.py and LAD_patch_z.py:
    - Take 4 arguments, t, s, g, i
        t = titration level
        s = section index
        g = CV group
        i = column index
    - Load .npy files from /numpy_files/
    - Select cells that are located within the region of interest
    - Compute and save W[:,i] and bias[i]
    
- patch.py and patch_z.py:
    - Take 2 arguments, t and s
        t = titration level
        s = section index
    - Load .npy files from /numpy_files/
    - At each section of embryo:
        - Gather the output from LAD_patch.py (LAD_patch_z.py) to get 10 W's and biases
        - Average W's and biases
        - Computes a fractional error vector and an error matrix
        - identify the test samples that are located within the region of interest
        - Compute an "in-house" fractional error vector and an 'in-house" error matrix
        - Saves the results as a dictionary
