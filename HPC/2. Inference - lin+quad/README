This folder contains materials for inferring a network using the complete training set.

make-swarm:
    - A bash script 
    - Command: bash make-swarm
    - Output: LAD.cmd
    
LAD.cmd:
    - 990 commands to run LAD_v.py (99 columns for each W of 10-fold cross-validation)
    
LAD_v.py:
    - Takes 1 argument, k
        k = computation index
        from k, obtain i and j
        i = int(k/10) column index
        j = np.mod(k,10) CV group
    - Loads .npy files from /numpy_files/
    - Computes and saves W[:,i] and bias[i]
    
99_99.py:
    - Loads .npy files from /numpy_files/
    - Gathers the output from LAD_v.py to get 10 W's and biases
    - Averages the W's and biases
    - Computes a fractional error vector and an error matrix
    - Saves the results as a dictionary
    - Command:
        python3 99_99.py
