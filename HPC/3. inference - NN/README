This folder contains materials for training neural networks with the complete training set.

make-swarm:
    - A bash script 
    - Command: bash make-swarm
    - Output: kr_mhidden_mae.cmd and kr_mhidden_mae_10000.cmd
    
kr_mhidden_mae.cmd
    - 15 commands to run nn_mhidden_mae.py with combinations of # of hidden layers and # of nodes on each hidden layer
    - 1-5 hidden layers, [50,100,1000] nodes
    
kr_mhidden_mae_10000.cmd
    - 5 commands to run nn_mhidden_mae.py with 1-5 hidden layers and 10000 nodes
    
nn_mhidden_mae.py:
    - Trains neural networks by minimizing the mean absolute errors
    - Takes 2 argument, n_layer and n_node
    - Loads .npy files from /numpy_files/
    - Saves the results as a dictionary
    
nn_mhidden_mse.py:
    - Trains neural networks by minimizing the mean squared errors
    - Takes 2 argument, n_layer and n_node
    - Loads .npy files from /numpy_files/
    - Saves the results as a dictionary
